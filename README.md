# Solomon
2018 OpenSourceProgramming in KNU __Learning Programming Grading_

To develop Solomon, We have to get some first step. 
First, if you don't have MAC environment, you can't contribute this project. 
Second, You should have a directory, "/Documents/usetFileSolomon.dir" 
If you don't have, don't worry about it. 
We serve ssh program to provide initial environment for develop.

So, If you pull file firstly, you have to execute "Solomon/SolomonInit"

example)

$ ssh SolomonInit
